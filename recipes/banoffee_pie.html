      <strong>Banoffe pie</strong> is a British dessert made from bananas, whipped cream and a caramel sauce,
      combined on a biscuit base, made from crumbled biscuits and butter. Its name is a combination
      of the word "banana" and "toffe". 
    </p>
    <p>
      The credit for the pie's invention is claimed by <strong>Nigel Mackenzie</strong> and <strong>Ian Dowding</strong>, the owner and chef,
      respectively, of the - now closed - <em>Hungry Monk Restaurant</em> in Jevington, East Sussex, England.

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the oven to <strong>180 degrees</strong>. <em>Make the crust</em>: In a medium bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs,
        melted butter, sugar and salt. Stir until fully incorporated and sandy. Transfer to a <strong>15 centimeters</strong> 
        pie plate. Using your fingers or a flat-bottomed cup, press the mixture into the pie plate and up the sides.
        Make sure it is well packed. Bake until set, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes, 
        or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate up to 2 days.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Spoon the dulce de leche into the pie crust and spread into an even layer. Pile in banana slices into a relatively
        even layer (they should overlap). Transfer the pie to the refrigerator while you make the whipped cream.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <em>Make the whipped cream</em>: Using a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the heavy
        cream, sugar, vanilla extract and instant coffee, if using, on medium-high speed until firm peaks form, 1 to 2
        minutes.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        To serve, sprinkle the pie with chocolate shavings or fresh coffee grounds, if desired. Store leftover pie in the
        refrigerator, covered, for up to <strong>5 days</strong>. The whipped cream may lose some height, but the pie will be no less delicious.
